## Hey, I speak one (or more) of these languages and some of these translations seem a little rough. What's up?
The developers of Grindstone speak English.
Many of Grindstone's users do not, primarily.
The best that we can do on our own is pump all the English text in the app through a translation API to produce approximate translations.

## I have some free time and I'm pretty sure I could clean this up a bit.
Great!

For a tutorial on how to fork repos and submit PRs, see: https://youtu.be/nT8KGYVurIU

Changes from approved PRs will make their way into subsequent releases of Grindstone!

As you are translating, please feel free to clear or alter the comment field for entries which we have added, indicating that the entry was automatically translated.

As we add new features (and new text) to Grindstone, we will also submit our own PRs to this repo to include the new text.
It will be automatically translated by machine, so you will be able to make future contributions for native speakers of your language if you wish.

## Do I get credit for my work?
Absolutely!
Find the entry called "Contributors" in each resource file to which you have contributed and add your name to the list of folks that have contributed for that language.
Make sure this change is a part of the PR you submit to us.
Grindstone will display this list of contributors in its About dialog.

## My language isn't even here. May I add it?
Yes!
Just submit a PR like you would above, except with the addition of a whole new file.
Just make sure you use the appropriate ISO 639-1 code of the language in its file name.
